## Troubleshoot
- To be able to access location features in developer environment Chrome requires the page to run using https protocol. 
  To circumvent that add an exception in Chrome flags. In url bar type: 
  `chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure`
  and put the dapp exception in: `http://localhost:3000, http://{YOUR_IP}:3000`
