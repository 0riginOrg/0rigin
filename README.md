This branch is just for recording listings to feature or hide from public demo.

- `featurelist_X.txt` contians comma-seperated list of listing id's to be featured. 
- `hidelist_X.txt` contians comma-seperated list of listing id's to be hidden. 


`X` represents the network number it is for. E.g. Mainnet is 1, Rinkeby network is 4 and Ropsten network is 3.
