# What we're building

The main components of this repo will be:

 - Origin.js
 - Ethereum smart contracts
 - Origin DApp that's built on top of origin.js (basically our current demo-dapp reworked to use origin.js)

This library will provide an abstraction layer for developers who want to build DApps on our protocol.

The library will make it easy for sellers to do things like:

 - Create listings
 - Update listings
 - Delete listings
 - Validate listings
 
And buyers to:
 
 - Browse listing
 - Create bookings
 - Update bookings
 - Cancel bookings
