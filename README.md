# Origin.js

Work in progress.

Origin.js is a javascript library for interfacing with Origin standards.

This library will provide an abstraction layer for developers who want to build DApps on our protocol.

The library will make it easy for sellers to do things like:

 - Create listings
 - Update listings
 - Delete listings
 - Validate listings
 
And buyers to:
 
 - Browse listing
 - Create bookings
 - Update bookings
 - Cancel bookings

Please refer to our [product brief](http://www.originprotocol.com/product-brief) 
and [technical whitepaper](http://www.originprotocol.com/whitepaper) to see our latest thinking.

You can also [join our engineering channels on Slack](http://slack.originprotocol.com) to 
participate in the latest discussions.
