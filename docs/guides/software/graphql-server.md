The Origin GraphQL Server provides very fast access to Origin data (both from the blockchain and from IPFS). This allows DApps to be tremendously faster than querrying the blockchain themselves and downloading and processing potentialy many distributed files per listing.

Play with it live here at [graphql.originprotocol.com](https://graphql.originprotocol.com). Because it's GraphQL, there are self-documenting schemas available under the docs tab.

Setup instructions can be found in the [README](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/tree/master/infra/discovery/src/apollo).
