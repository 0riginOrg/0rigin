The Origin Bridge Server handles the server side of identity attestations and verification. For example, to verify a user's Twitter account, the bridge server can connect to Twitter to verify that that user made a tweet with the required text.

Origin hosts a Bridge Server, but in the true spirit of decentralization, anyone is free to clone our open source code and host their own. DApps can connect to the Bridge Server of their choosing.

You can connect to and use our hosted Bridge Server at [https://bridge.originprotocol.com](https://bridge.originprotocol.com).
