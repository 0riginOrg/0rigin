The Origin Discovery Server provides search capabilites for Origin Listings. Data is stored in a local Elasticsearch, fed by the [Event Listener](event-listener).

The Discovery Server powers the main search functionality of the Origin DApp and handles listing search rankings.

For setup instructions, see the [README](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/tree/master/infra/discovery/src/apollo).
