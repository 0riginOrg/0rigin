Origin provides a simple and powerful JavaScript library for developers to build decentralized marketplaces, allowing buyers and sellers to meet and transact without any trusted intermediaries.

### Usage

Visit our GitHub: [https://github.com/OriginProtocol](https://github.com/OriginProtocol)

This documentation will explain how developers can use the Origin platform to create and manage decentralized marketplaces that are built on top of [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs) and the [Ethereum network](https://www.ethereum.org/).

Origin aims to create an easy and flexible abstraction layer that:

* Generates and deploys secure Ethereum smart contracts to the blockchain.
* Creates and posts user and listing metadata to distributed IPFS nodes
* Queries against open-source indexing servers to render content in decentralized applications (DApps)

Origin enables developers to create DApps that allow users to create listings, make purchases, manage their identities, and more.

### Notes

Please note that this project is still under heavy development and many necessary features have not yet been implemented. This library should not be considered production-ready.

The entire Origin Protocol project is 100% open-source and we welcome contributions from the community. There are many ways to help, from reporting issues and contributing code, to helping us improve and grow our community.
