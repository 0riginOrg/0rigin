Origin Messaging is an end-to-end encrypted messaging system based on Ethereum addresses. The messaging server stores encrypted messages and public keys, allowing users to communicate. The message and key format is designed to support a more distributed messaging backend in the future.

For more details on the Origin Messaging Server setup, see the [README](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/blob/master/infra/messaging/src/models/message.js).
