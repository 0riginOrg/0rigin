# Development

To get started quickly, you can run a "light" version of the Origin DApp, which
automatically sets up our DApp, a local IPFS server, and a local blockchain.

Or you can use a more full featured development environment with Docker Compose
orchestrating several containers and providing access to the full suite of the
Origin DApp features, including messaging, browser notifications, and
attestation services.

## Quick start - Running a local DApp

1. Check out the repository from GitHub and make sure you have installed all the
   necessary dependencies:

```
git clone
cd origin && npm install
```

2. You can then start the marketplace DApp using:

```
npm start
```

This will start a `webpack-dev-server` with hot reloading on
`http://localhost:3000.`. When you open it you should some sample listings.

### Network selection

You can also change the Ethereum network being used by the marketplace DApp by
appending a network name to the URL.

- http://localhost:3000/rinkeby - Ethereum Rinkeby backed by Origin staging
  services (e.g. https://dapp.staging.originprotocol.com)
- http://localhost:3000/mainnet - Ethereum Mainnet backed by Origin production
  services (e.g. https://dapp.originprotocol.com)

### Other settings

The marketplace DApp includes a settings page at
`http://localhost:3000/settings` that is useful if you want to switch individual
services, e.g. use a different Web3 provider or attestation server.

### About the Origin repository

Origin uses a monorepo setup that is managed by `lerna`. The `--hoist` flag of
`lerna` is used to pull common dependencies to the root of the monorepo on
installation.


#### Port errors

The environment requires a number of ports to be free on your machine (3000,
5000, 5002, 8080, 8081 and 8545). If one of these ports isn't available,
spinning up the development environment may fail. This includes `@origin/dapp`
and `@origin/admin`. Ensure you start those after you run `docker-compose up`.

#### Metamask errors

Sometimes Metamask gets confused on private networks. If you see errors
generated by Metamask in your console while developing, clicking
`Settings`â†’`Reset Account` in Metamask should resolve the issue.
