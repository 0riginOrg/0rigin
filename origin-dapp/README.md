Head to https://www.originprotocol.com/developers to learn more about what we're building and how to get involved.

Just getting started with Origin? We recommend using [Origin Box](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/tree/master/development#origin-box) for development and testing on your local machine.

# Origin DApp

This is an example DApp (Decentralized Application) that shows how easy it is to create a truly peer to peer marketplace on the Ethereum blockchain with **origin-js**. Using only javascript, you can create and purchase listings, leave reviews, check identity, and more.

- [origin-js code](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/tree/master/origin-js)
- [origin-js documentation](http://docs.originprotocol.com/)

To learn more about Origin Protocol, please read our [product brief](https://www.originprotocol.com/product-brief) and [whitepaper](https://www.originprotocol.com/whitepaper) for a high-level description of what we're building and why it matters. Our official website is [https://www.originprotocol.com](https://www.originprotocol.com).

## Try the DApp

 - [Mainnet](https://dapp.originprotocol.com). See [instructions](https://medium.com/originprotocol/draft-origin-launches-beta-on-mainnet-draft-e3b70161ae86).
 - [Testnet (Rinkeby network)](https://demo.staging.originprotocol.com)

To use the DApp you will need to install and configure the [MetaMask browser extension](https://metamask.io). Once you have set up a wallet you will need to make sure that you have selected the correct Ethereum network depending on which version of the DApp you are using.

If you are running on Rinkeby you can get test Ether from the [Rinkeby faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io). You can also get test OGN tokens from the [Origin faucet](https://faucet.originprotocol.com).

Create a listing and post it to IPFS and Ethereum.

## Browser & Wallet Compatibility
Browsers with wallets for both desktop and mobile that you can use with the Origin Demo DApp.

## Localization
See [translations](translations) directory.

## Deploy on Heroku or IPFS

To deploy a development copy of the site on Heroku, follow the instructions:
```
git clone https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin.git && cd origin
git subtree push --prefix origin-dapp heroku master
```

You will need to set some configuration variables for your Heroku deployment. We recommend using the same configuration as our Rinkeby testnet deployment. See https://demo.staging.originprotocol.com/#/dapp-info
