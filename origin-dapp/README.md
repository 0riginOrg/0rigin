Head to https://www.originprotocol.com/developers to learn more about what we're building and how to get involved.

Just getting started with Origin? We recommend using [Origin Box](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/tree/master/development#origin-box) for development and testing on your local machine.

# Origin Demo DApp
This is an example DApp (Decentralized Application) that shows how easy it is to create a truly peer to peer marketplace on the Ethereum blockchain with **origin-js**. Using only javascript, you can create and purchase listings, leave reviews, check identity, and more.

- [origin-js code](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/tree/master/origin-js)
- [origin-js documentation](http://docs.originprotocol.com/)

To learn more about Origin Protocol, please read our [product brief](https://www.originprotocol.com/product-brief) and [whitepaper](https://www.originprotocol.com/whitepaper) for a high-level description of what we're building and why it matters. Our official website is [https://www.originprotocol.com](https://www.originprotocol.com).

## Try the DApp

 - [Mainnet](https://dapp.originprotocol.com). See [instructions](https://medium.com/originprotocol/draft-origin-launches-beta-on-mainnet-draft-e3b70161ae86).
 - [Testnet (Rinkeby network)](https://demo.staging.originprotocol.com)


## Run Demo DApp

### 1. Check node version

Make sure you have `node` version 8.5.0 or greater

```
node --version
```

### 2. Set up DApp

In a new tab:
```
git clone https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin.git && cd origin/origin-dapp
npm install
npm run start
```

A browser will open to http://localhost:3000. If you don't have the MetaMask extension (or another wallet provider) follow instructions of the next step.

### 3. Set up MetaMask

- Install [MetaMask Chrome Browser Extension](https://metamask.io/).

- Follow the instructions to set up your wallet.

- Click where it says "Ethereum Main Network" and select "Rinkeby Test Network" or "Ropsten Test Network". This takes us off of the real Ethereum network and onto a test network. Ethers on test networks cannot be exchanged for fiat currency.

**Be careful not to mix up your test wallet with your real one on the Main Network.**

### 4. Get test ether

Get Rinkeby ether from the [Rinkeby faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/).

### 5. Try it!
Create a listing and post it to IPFS and Ethereum.

## Run Demo DApp with local origin-js and local blockchain

If you want to hack on origin-js code, or if you just want to use a private local blockchain, follow these instructions.

### 1. Set up and run origin-js locally

[Follow these instructions to setup and run origin-js.](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin/tree/master/origin-js#local-development)

### 2. Set up the DApp for local development

Leave origin-js running and create a new terminal window. Then run the following:
```bash
cd origin/origin-dapp
cp dev.env .env  # Use development env vars
npm run start
```

Your browser will open to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and display the DApp.

### 3. Connect to your local blockchain in MetaMask

-  Log out of MetaMask.

- Click `Restore from seed phrase`

- Enter the following seed phrase (Mnemonic):
```
candy maple cake sugar pudding cream honey rich smooth crumble sweet treat
```
This is the default seed phrase used by [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle) for development.

 ‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful not to mix up your test wallet with your real one on the Main Network.

- Click where it says "Ethereum Main Network" and select "Localhost 8545". Click the back arrow to return to your account.

- You should see your first test account now has 100 ETH and the address `0x627306090abaB3A6e1400e9345bC60c78a8BEf57`. Additional generated accounts will also have this amount.

## Browser & Wallet Compatibility
Browsers with wallets for both desktop and mobile that you can use with the Origin Demo DApp.

## Localization
See [translations](translations) directory.

## Deploy on Heroku or IPFS

To deploy a development copy of the site on Heroku, follow the instructions:
```
git clone https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin.git && cd origin
git subtree push --prefix origin-dapp heroku master
```

You will need to set some configuration variable for your Heroku deployment. We recommend using the same configuration as our Rinkeby testnet deployment. See https://demo.staging.originprotocol.com/#/app-info

Since this app is just a bunch of HTML and JavaScript, you can also deploy and use it directly from IPFS. Just run:

```
cd origin-dapp/script
./scripts/deploy-ipfs.sh
```
